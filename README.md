## Inspiration ‚ù§
This app is the first application that I am making with better UI using Figma. With the help of modern UI design, I am motivated to create better designs for my Android Apps.

## Features and Functionality üî•
1. Customizable UI - The user can change styles for timer, fonts, background image and music, and as well as reposition the timer to avoid obstruction of background image.
2. Set Custom Pomodoro Style - User can set their study time, breaks and long breaks.
3. Supports Multiple Screen Support- For tablets.
